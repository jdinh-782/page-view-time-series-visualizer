# page-view-time-series-visualizer
This program grabs and cleans data from the number of page views that were recorded in the FreeCodeCamp forum page from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. Using Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and SeaBorn helped with the cleaning and visualizing of the data into a line chart, bar graph, and box plot.
